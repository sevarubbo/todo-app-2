# React Components Guidelines

## Component Structure
- Use inline interfaces for props definition:
```tsx
export const MyComponent = ({ prop1, prop2 }: { prop1: string; prop2: number }) => {
  // component implementation
}
```

## Design System Usage
- Prefer using design-system components whenever possible
- Only create custom components when the design system doesn't provide the needed functionality
- When extending design system components, document why a custom solution was needed
