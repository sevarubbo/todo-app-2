# Linear GraphQL API Integration

When working with Linear.app, always use their GraphQL API at https://api.linear.app/graphql.

## API Documentation
- Full API documentation: https://linear.app/developers/graphql
- Authentication: Use API key in Authorization header
- Base URL: https://api.linear.app/graphql

## Team Information
- Team ID: 27a11537-4a78-47ac-bab1-0bb49f431bd1
- Team Name: App0002

## Prerequesites
- Source the `.env` file before making API calls. `.env` file is there though you don't see it.

## Common Operations
1. Get teams:
```graphql
{
  teams {
    nodes {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

2. Get issues:
```graphql
{
  team(id: "TEAM_ID") {
    issues {
      nodes {
        id
        title
        description
        state {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Create issue:
```graphql
mutation {
  issueCreate(input: {
    title: "Issue title"
    description: "Issue description"
    teamId: "27a11537-4a78-47ac-bab1-0bb49f431bd1"
  }) {
    success
    issue {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication
Always include the API key in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: <API_KEY>
```

## Environment Setup
1. Store your Linear API key in `.env` file:
```
LINEAR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. Source the `.env` file before using the API:
```bash
source .env
```
